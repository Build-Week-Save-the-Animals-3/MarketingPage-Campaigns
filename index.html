                <p>Key Conservation is helping conservationists receive critical funding and increased global support through an app that provides real-time updates on day-to-day campaigns. Most of the worlds biggest animals could be extinct by 2100 if we don't take drastic measures. We can stop global extinction if we utilize new technology and interact with supporters in ways that they want!</p>

                    <p>The eastern lowland gorilla’s range has declined by at least a quarter over the last 50 years. The last census, in the mid-1990s, estimated that there were only 16,900 of the animals left in the wild, but following more than a decade of habitat destruction and fragmentation and years of civil unrest, the eastern lowland gorilla’s population may have declined by half or more.

                    <p>The number of jaguars has declined over the last 100 years mainly because humans have slashed and burned many of their homelands in Central and South America; new cities are being built, and the forests and grasslands are being cleared. The destruction of the jaguar's habitat from logging and cattle ranching as well as having to compete with humans for food has brought a large decease in its population.</p>

                    <p>As the human population in China continues to grow, pandas’ habitat gets taken over by development. Habitat destruction leads to food shortages. Pandas feed on several varieties of bamboo that bloom at different times of the year. If one type of bamboo is destroyed by development, it can leave the pandas with nothing to eat during the time it normally blooms, increasing the risk of starvation.</p>

                <p>Koalas are in serious decline suffering from the effects of habitat destruction, domestic dog attacks, bushfires and road accidents. The Australian Koala Foundation estimates that there are less than 100,000 Koalas left in the wild, possibly as few as 43,000.</p>
